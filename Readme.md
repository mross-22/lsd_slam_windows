# LSD-SLAM for Windows Fork

This fork simplifies building LSD-SLAM on Windows with [Visual Studio 2015 (VS14)](http://www.visualstudio.com).

# Prerequisites

Install pre-build binaries of [OpenCV 3.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.2.0/opencv-3.2.0-vc14.exe/download) 
and [Boost Library 1.64.0 x64 for VS 2015](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe/download).

# Building the Solution

Open LSD-SLAM.sln in Visual Studio 2015 and correct the paths in the LSD-SLAM.props which can be found in the 'Settings' folder of the solution.



# LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM

LSD-SLAM is a novel approach to real-time monocular SLAM. It is fully direct (i.e. does not use keypoints / features) and creates large-scale, 
semi-dense maps in real-time on a laptop. For more information see
[http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam)
where you can also find the corresponding publications and Youtube videos, as well as some 
example-input datasets, and the generated output as rosbag or .ply point cloud.
